# GHG Quantification of Intermodal Transportation in the Construction Material Supply Chain

This repository includes an Excel spreadsheet that was used to calculate different scenarios for the use of the "CemTainer" for combined road-rail transportation in the construction material supply chain. The paper is accepted for presentation at the Construction Logistics, Equipment, and Robotics (CLEaR) conference at TU Munich and will be published afterwards.
